#Portfolio
Hi Surya,
I hope you're doing well. My name is Niraj Modi, and I'm currently a Final Year Student at Asansol Engineering College and a Full-stack Developer Intern at a US-based startup (www.dair.cloud). I'm very interested in internship/fulltime opportunities at IndMoney and was wondering if you might refer me. 

Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Web Developer with skills in C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJs, NextJs, and NodeJs. I have experience in developing scalable web applications, optimizing API calls, and working with MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

I have a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and have demonstrated my skills through various projects and leadership roles, such as serving as the Google Developer Student Clubs Lead (2023-24).

Any support or guidance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for considering my request! You can find my resume here :- https://nirajmodi.me/assets/NirajModi_Resume.pdf
